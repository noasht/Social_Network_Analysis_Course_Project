# 🚀 OTCproject

A graph-based analysis of user rating behavior in Bitcoin over-the-counter (OTC) trading.
---
## 🧠 What’s this about?
This project was developed as part of a Social Network Analysis course.

It explores whether voting bias exists in peer ratings — specifically, whether users who receive positive feedback are more likely to give positive ratings themselves (and vice versa for negative).
Using a real-world dataset of Bitcoin OTC trades, we constructed a user-to-user rating graph and analyzed patterns of reciprocity, clustering, and sentiment bias.

## 📊 Key Questions

- Is there evidence of echo chambers?
